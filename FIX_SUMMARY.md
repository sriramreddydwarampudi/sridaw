# SriDAW Fix Summary

## Issue
The SriDAW application was failing to run due to missing dependencies, specifically Kivy was not installed and the environment was not properly configured.

## Root Cause
1. **Missing Kivy Installation**: The main issue was that Kivy was not installed in the system
2. **Externally Managed Environment**: The system Python environment was externally managed, preventing direct installation of packages
3. **Missing System Dependencies**: Various system libraries required for Kivy were not installed

## Solution Applied

### 1. System Dependencies Installation
Installed all required system dependencies for Kivy:
```bash
sudo apt install -y python3.13-venv python3-pip libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libportmidi-dev libswscale-dev libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev zlib1g-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good build-essential
```

### 2. Virtual Environment Setup
Created and activated a Python virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Python Dependencies Installation
Installed Kivy and other required packages:
```bash
pip install kivy>=2.3.1 buildozer>=1.5.0
```

### 4. Scripts Created
- `setup.sh` - Automated setup script for the entire environment
- `run_app.sh` - Easy script to run the application
- Updated `requirements.txt` with working versions

## Files Modified
- `requirements.txt` - Updated with working Kivy version and buildozer
- `setup.sh` - Created new setup script
- `run_app.sh` - Created new run script
- `FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

## Current Status
✅ **FIXED**: The application environment is now properly configured
✅ **WORKING**: Kivy 2.3.1 is installed and functional
✅ **WORKING**: Local music21 implementation loads correctly
✅ **READY**: Android build tools (buildozer) are installed

## How to Use
1. **Setup (first time)**: Run `./setup.sh`
2. **Run Application**: Use `./run_app.sh`
3. **Build Android APK**: Use `./build.sh`

## Technical Details
- **Python Version**: 3.13.3
- **Kivy Version**: 2.3.1
- **Virtual Environment**: Located in `venv/` directory
- **Music21**: Local implementation in `music21/` directory
- **Build Tool**: Buildozer 1.5.0 for Android builds

The fix ensures that the application can now run properly with all dependencies resolved and provides a maintainable environment for development and building.
